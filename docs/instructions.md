# Instructions

We did this assignment on the first day of class, before creating our Canvas accounts. If you were absent or joint the class late:

1. Get a notebook and hanging folder from me.
1. Follow along in the [slides][] to set up your notebook.
1. Switch to the Submission tab for the checklist for submitting your assignment.

## Notes

The basics of good notetaking:

* Date your notes.
* Think text messages -- most of us can't write fast enough to take down exactly what is said. Get the high points, fill in your notes later.
* Practice, you *will* get better.
